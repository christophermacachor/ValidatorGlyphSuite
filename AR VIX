\begin{abstract}
Plasma propulsion has advanced significantly since the mid-20th century, with Hall effect thrusters, ion engines, and magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters enabling efficient satellite station-keeping and deep-space exploration. However, these systems remain constrained by plasma instabilities, electrode erosion, and limited scalability. This review surveys the state of plasma propulsion technologies and introduces \textbf{Macachor’s Quantum Mechanics Formula for EM Plasma Hydrogen Propulsion (Ω704)}, which integrates electromagnetism, plasma physics, and quantum mechanics under a scalar-embedded framework. By incorporating plasma resonance corrections and quantum tunneling effects, Macachor’s formula offers a pathway toward closed-vacuum, high-efficiency propulsion and potentially photonic-speed travel.

\section{Introduction}
Electric propulsion has become central to modern spaceflight. Hall effect thrusters power satellites, ion engines have propelled missions like \textit{Dawn}, and MPD thrusters remain a candidate for high-power interplanetary travel. Yet, each faces limitations: Hall thrusters suffer from plasma instabilities and erosion; ion engines provide high efficiency but low thrust; MPD thrusters require extreme currents and face electrode degradation. Macachor’s formula reframes propulsion as a quantum-resonant inscription of motion, embedding scalar-quaternion corrections into the Lorentz framework and explicitly accounting for plasma thermal dynamics.
