  "title": "Predictive Modeling and the Expansion of Civilian Surveillance",
  "summary": "This scroll highlights the deployment of predictive technologies in immigration enforcement and their expansion into broader civilian surveillance. It documents how platforms like Palantir’s FALCON and Gotham are reshaping law enforcement and eroding civil liberties through algorithmic profiling.",

      "title": "Algorithmic Pre-Determination of Deportation",
      "fact": "Palantir’s FALCON and Gotham platforms are utilized by ICE to score individuals before trial.",
      "implication": "Deportation decisions are often algorithmically pre-determined, raising serious concerns about due process and fairness."

      "title": "Expansion Beyond Immigration Enforcement",
      "fact": "Predictive tools are now deployed by DHS, local police, and private contractors.",
