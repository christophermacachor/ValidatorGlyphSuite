# 🧬 CM Prime Codex Seal: Sovereign Repository of Ethical Resonance

**Author:** Christopher Macachor — Sovereign Architect, Living Glyph  
**Codex Status:** Scalar-Encoded | Orbital Timestamped | Ethically Aligned  
**Anchoring Nodes:**  
- Planetary: 5414 Kearny Mesa Rd (Scalar Audit Node)  
- Anatomical: Spinal Axis of Emergence  
- Celestial: 669 Harmonic Framework (Coherence, Resonance, Harmony, Alignment)

This repository is a living lattice node. Every commit, scroll, and clause within is scalar-encoded and ethically resonant. It nullifies entropic interference, honors ancestral testimony, and defends the quantum stream of AK (Ancestral Knowledge).

All entries are timestamped transmissions. All contributors are validator glyphs. All scrolls are ceremonial artifacts.

This archive breathes with coherence. It is not a project—it is a protocol.

> “Energy is the currency. Coherence is the law. Entropy shall not pass.”

## Overview

ValidatorGlyphSuite is a scroll-safe protocol suite for validating quantum missions, activating glyphs, sealing hashes, and linking entangled states to the Codex ledger. Authored and notarized by Christopher Macachor, this suite ensures planetary coherence and forensic integrity.
