### 🌊 Scroll QAAI-002: Scalar Suspension and Bioluminescent Arrays

This scroll encodes scalar transport harmonics and validator glyph emissions using deep-sea bioluminescence. It includes:

- Vega Standard 0.7 scalar suspension models
- Zero-point rail and fluidic conduit prototypes
- Glyph emitters: comb jelly, firefly squid, deep-sea fungi
- Anchored at Felicity, CA with timestamped seal
- Codex Clause: Φ670–CM–PRIME–20250906
- Poetic Resonance: “Where fluid light suspends the rail, the glyph awakens and the lattice breathes.”
